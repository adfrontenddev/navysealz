               <h2 id="pw">Pressure Washing and Soft Washing Services</h2>

               <p><span class="fw-bold">Pressure Washing</span> is the use of high-pressure water spray to remove loose paint, stubborn mold, grime, dust, mud, and dirt from surfaces and objects such as buildings, vehicles and concrete surfaces.</p>

               <p>
                  <span class="fw-bold">Soft Washing</span> is a cleaning method using low pressure and specialized solutions to safely remove mildew, bacteria, algae and other organic stains from roofs and other building exteriors. Soft washing is an alternate effective way to take care of the
                  external surface of your home or business.
               </p>
               <p>
                  Soft washing differs from power washing because the pressure is considerably lower, which minimizes damage to surfaces, especially those areas that are currently in questionable condition. Soft washing solutions are biodegradable and eco-friendly. Even if these solutions contain
                  bleach, it is calculatively diluted with water, making it is safe to use.
               </p>
               <p>Pressure Washing and Soft Washing can be applied to all surfaces providing equally clean results while extending the life of surfaces including but not limited to:</p>

               <h2>Benefits of power washing or soft washing your home or business</h2>
               <h3>Protecting the biggest investment of your life.</h3>
               <p>
                  Considering your home or business is the largest investment in your life, wouldn't you want to ensure its longevity in the best condition possible? Power washing or soft washing will not only reveal the beauty of your property, but also increase, if not maintain it's value. If you
                  want your investment to look its best and avoid early deterioration, you should consider providing regular maintenance.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="d-block fw-bold">1. Saves You Money</span>
                  If your roof, building exterior, fence or any other property that you deem important appears to be neglected, you should address the issue to prevent further deterioration by power washing your property by eliminating stubborn mold, grime, dust, mud, and dirt from surfaces that may
                  cause potential harm. Pressure washing your property will prolong the life span and protect your property form elements that can cause damage earlier than expected, saving you money on those costly repairs..
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="d-block fw-bold">2. Increases the Longevity of Your Investment</span>
                  Many months or weeks of Florida rain and humidity can make any home start looking undesirable. Mildew does not only pose a health risk to your family, it can also cause an expensive damage to your home's external environment. Damage like neglected lichen, fungi, and algae on your
                  property will reduce the lifespan of your investment. Regular maintenance of your property will prevent early sign of damage leaving it strong and healthy. A dirty surface will develop further into more problematic issues..
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="d-block fw-bold">3. Saves Energy </span>
                  Dirty, dark and stained roof is not just an eyesore to you and your community, it also causes increments in the cost of electricity during the summer. Compromised surfaces attract more sun because dark roofs in color absorb more heat than clean roofs. This heat absorbed makes your
                  home warmer and your electricity bill higher from compensating the temperature of your A/C.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="d-block fw-bold">5. Safe Environment</span>
                  Mildew and mold can instigate and irritate a entire slew of respiratory issues and allergic reactions. If this bacteria is growing on your property's exterior, it can soon grow inside your home and thereby posing a great threat to your family or employees. The moment you notice
                  that mold is growing on the outside of your home, call in the Sealz Team. Soft washing will not only reduce the mold and mildew, but also kills these organisms at the root.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <span class="d-block fw-bold">6. Eco-Friendly</span>
                  In addition to saving you money on electricity, soft washing is also eco-friendly. This is because soft washing uses a biodegradable solution that destroys organisms and their offspring at their root. Harsher chemical methods of cleaning the exterior of your home can destroy the
                  grass and or plants around your house. Soft washing is eco-friendly and applies with a significantly lower pressure than power washing, satisfying our eco-friendly customers.
